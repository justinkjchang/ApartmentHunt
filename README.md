# Apartment Hunt Visualization

This project is a simple web application that will help visualize the pros and cons of various apartments, including distance to work, rent price per month, sq. ft., etc. It's built using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and took advantage of [simple angular seed](https://github.com/reinaldo13/simple-angular-seed), which is a basic skeleton for general AngularJS applications.


This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly start your angular webapp projects.

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application. It is all HTML, JS and CSS. It doesn't install anything else in your dev environment, so no dependencies! I did this on purpose so you have control over your web server, test and dev tools, etc.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.

## Getting Started

Simply clone the ApartmentHunt repository

```
git clone https://github.com/justinkjchang/ApartmentHunt.git
cd ApartmentHunt
```

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository. You can get it from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

### Run the Application

You can either run your app locally or host it using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

#### Note:

Some ajax calls are done with angular, and as a result, the project needs to be hosted on a web server.
One option would be to use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
Install: npm install -g http-server
Run: http-server $dir
